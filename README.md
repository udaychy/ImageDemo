# ImageDemo
This is a demo on storing the images as base64 string in indexed DB using  [JsStore][l_jsstore].

It would be very easy to understand if you are familiar with Jquery and JsStore. 
In case you need, you can go through [Jquery Tutorial][l_jquery_w3] and [JsStore Tutorial][l_jsstore_tutorial].

We are just converting the image into base64 String and storing it in the Indexed DB as a string and use that string to display the image whereever needed
